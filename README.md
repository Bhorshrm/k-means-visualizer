# k-means-visualizer
The K-Means Visualizer is a data analysis and visualization tool designed to facilitate the exploration and understanding of the K-Means clustering algorithm, a fundamental technique in unsupervised machine learning. It provides an interactive interface to help users grasp the concept of clustering and its application in real-world scenarios.

Key Features:

Interactive Clustering: Users can input their dataset or use sample datasets to apply the K-Means algorithm interactively.
Data Visualization: The tool offers 2D and 3D visualizations of data points, clusters, and centroids, aiding in the interpretation of clustering results.
Parameter Tuning: Users can experiment with various K values and initialization methods to observe their impact on clustering outcomes.
Result Evaluation: Provides metrics such as SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) to quantify the quality of clustering.
Technologies Used:

Programming Language: HTML,CSS,JS
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, cluster, Matplotlib
